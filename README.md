## Motivation 

Let's consider this scenario. You go shopping for groceries, and you always tell yourself that you will cook something with the things you bought. But you keep buying food using Uber Eats, and when you open the fridge again someday you realize that the things you bought are either moldy or past the expiration date. As a result we have not only wasted the food, but you have also spent a lot more money than you needed. Sound familiar? Let's be honest we are all a little guilty of this. 



## The Solution
To tackle this problem, we made a gamified management application that keeps track of the groceries you bought and constantly rreminds you about using them for meal prep. 

### Core Features:
1) Create your food iventory by scanning the QR codes of the items, or by manually entering your item.

2) AI to help suggest a grocery list based on past purchases with the goal to buy just enough ingredients so that unnecessary food waste is avoided.

2) Push notifications to remind you to do some cooking

3) Recipe Suggestions that you can follow to make meals with your current inventory. Your Pantry get's automatically updated when following a particular recipe. 

4) Gamification features like badges, streaks and rewards for spending more time cooking. 

5) Week-End analysis to show home much money the user has saved and how much food waste has been reduced
