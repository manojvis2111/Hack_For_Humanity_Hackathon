# Hack_For_Humanity_Hackathon

## Setup

1) Git clone the repository from the Github Link

1) Open one terminal, cd into the pantrai directory, run 'npm install', and then 'npm start'.

2) Open another terminal, cd into the server directory, run 'npm install', and then 'npm run serve'.

## Motivation 

Let's consider this scenario. You go shopping for groceries, and you always tell yourself that you will cook something with the things you bought. But you keep buying food using Uber Eats, and when you open the fridge again someday you realize that the things you bought are either moldy or past the expiration date. As a result we have not only wasted the food, but you have also spent a lot more money than you needed. Sound familiar? Let's be honest we are all a little guilty of this. 

## The Solution
To tackle this problem, we made a gamified grocery management application that keeps track of the groceries you bought and constantly reminds you about using them for meal prep. 

## Why it can make an impact
First, the idea of gamification has been on our radar for a while now. Applications like DuoLingo is proof that adding gamifications features like streak counter, keeps users motivated to stay on the task. 

Furthermore, we can develop this with a point system that gives an idea of how much a user is reducing food waste. We can leverage this point system in a manner that is similar to Canada's PC optimum point system in order to reach a wider audience and get discount grocery deals for users depending on the amount of points they have. This could motivate users a little more.

Therefore  

### Core Features:
1) Add items to your pantry with the quantity and shelf-life.

2) Reduce the quantity of a particular item by Clicking on the Use button.

3) Recipe Suggestions that you can follow to make meals with your current inventory.

4) Gamification features like streaks that keeps track of the number of days the user went without wasting anything.

5) Push notifications to help motivate and remind users about cooking your own meals. 

## Tools Used
MongoDB Atlas Database

Express

React

Node.js

Spoonacular API

## Future Work
 * Develop into a mobile application with features similar to 'Screen Zen'. More specifically, The app will remind you every time you order apps like UberEats that you still have things in the fridge and you can make something for yourself.

 * Make an AI that will analyze the users activity and help generate a grocery list so that you buy just enough food for one week.
